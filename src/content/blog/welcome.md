Welcome to my personal website! This is a space where I share my photography work and write about topics that interest me.

## About This Site

This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern static site generator that focuses on performance and developer experience. It features:

- **Photography Portfolio**: A curated collection of my photo projects, organized by theme or location
- **Blog**: Thoughts, stories, and technical writeups on various topics
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean, distraction-free presentation that puts the content first

## Photography Workflow

My photography workflow integrates seamlessly with this website:

1. I organize and edit photos in **Lightroom Classic**
2. Using JF Folder Publisher, I export selected photos to a designated folder
3. Photos are automatically discovered and optimized during the build process
4. EXIF data (camera settings, lens info, etc.) is extracted and displayed

This approach gives me complete control over which photos to share while keeping the technical details accessible for those interested.

## What to Expect

On this site, you'll find:

- **Photo Projects**: Collections of images from my travels, explorations, and creative experiments
- **Technical Posts**: Writeups about photography techniques, gear, and post-processing
- **Personal Reflections**: Thoughts on creativity, life, and the world around us

## Get in Touch

Feel free to explore the portfolio and blog. I hope you find something inspiring or interesting!
