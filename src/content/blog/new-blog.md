I've created lots of websites over the years but never stuck with any of them.   This time I have the intention to keep going with it and have a place to express myself and have my own digital footprint.

## Why Self-Host?

One thing that matters to me is having my own information and hosting it myself.   As one example I had a portfolio hosted on Adobe Porfolio, but then decided I liked the freedom of tools and didn't want to be locked into their system so I ended up giving up on it.

I wish I had stuck with my [first website](https://github.com/dcardamo/wwwindex) and evolved it over the years.  Its 25 years old (as I write this), I wrote it myself in Perl.  Its just the code to host the site, I wish I had the content still.
[My photo album](https://github.com/dcardamo/palbum) was written by myself too in the same year.  Also written in Perl.

I really enjoyed doing these myself.

I don't like social platforms like Meta.  They build those to solve their own financial benefits and use their users to their own benefit.  

Also one time I had content removed by Google Youtube for violating their policies, and it was the most innocent video of my daughter playing.  There was no contact to talk to or have a conversation to know more.  A great reminder that if you don't have your own data, someone else may decide to delete it or take it from you in the future for any reason.

So here I am rolling my own and owning my own data.  I'm happy with that!

## The Technology Stack

My technology stack surprisingly starts with Claude Code.  Its amazing I can roll my own fairly custom site and customize it quickly to my own needs.

Using it, I setup and customized my own [Astro.build](astro.build) site.  Its fairly minimal, lets me add in my own code (which Claude Code writes for me), and generates a static site.

I host this myself, and you can see [the code](https://github.com/dcardamo/www) for it.

## Photos Integration

I wanted to make it really easy to add photos to my portfolio online.   So a simple directory in this project has photos and more directories which become projects to organize.   So I can add more photos by just placing them in the directory.


In closing, welcome to my new home page on the internet.
